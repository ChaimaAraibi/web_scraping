# web_scraping
This web scraping example uses BeautifulSoup to retrieve images and alt texts from a list of websites.
It saves the images with their alt texts as the images names, creates a list of the sources and alts, calculates the amount of images with and without alt texts in those websites for some analysis needed in our project.
